# Tableau-Project-Comparison-of-Region-Based-on-Sales
Leveraging the power of data visualization, I explored sales data across different regions, uncovering key insights and trends that drive business growth.
With Tableau's intuitive dashboards and interactive charts, I transformed complex data into visually compelling stories, making it easy for stakeholders to grasp the big picture.

SUMMARY

A top organization's director wants to compare sales figures between two regions. In order to compare sales data by region, he has ordered each operator in each region to record it. The aim of the dashboard visualization of sales data is to help upper management identify areas for development and have a better understanding of their respective performances.


Objective: Assist the company by building a dashboard that compares sales data for two chosen regions.
